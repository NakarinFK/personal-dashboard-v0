# Personal Dashboard v0

This repository contains the v0 specification for my personal dashboard system.
The goal is to unify planning, tracking, and knowledge workflows.

## Why this exists
I currently use:
- Notion: short-term dashboards (money tracker, daily planning timeline)
- Obsidian: long-term second brain + daily tracker

Long term: replace Notion dashboards with a custom-built dashboard (vibe code),
while keeping Obsidian as the knowledge layer.

## Scope (v0)
- Document the vision and requirements
- Define a minimal feature set (MVP)
- Draft a basic data model
- Create wireframes
- Track decisions and trade-offs

## Docs
- `VISION.md` — the “why”
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` — functional & non-functional requirements
- `FEATURES.md` — MVP feature list
- `DATA_MODEL.md` — entities and relationships
- `ROADMAP.md` — phases
- `DECISIONS/` — decision log and trade-offs

## Status
Spec-first (no code yet). Implementation will follow after v0 is stable.
