# Vision

A personal operating system that helps me:
- plan the day with clarity
- track money & habits consistently
- store knowledge in a durable way
- reduce friction between tools

The system should be modular:
- short-term dashboards (planning/money)
- long-term knowledge (notes)
- future automation and AI assistance
